# DaveDES - A DES Cryptographic Program
Developed for the goal of understanding how to implement DES, the vulnerabilities of DES, and how different cryptographic modes of operations work. 

## How to run: 
python davedes.py

## Description Section
DES encrypts its content in blocks. There are different modes of
operation for cipher block encryptions.

The program covers 
- EBC: For each plaintext block, there is a matching cipher text block

- CBC: The cipher text output is based on the plaintext input and a previous cipher block or an initialization vector XOR'd together. 

For now.
